# 1. Business Challenge

House Rocket is digital real estate business that uses advanced technology to make better and smarter investments.

In this project I am going to help the CEO to find the best market opportunities in King County, USA.

The main strategy is to find houses with a low price and good location to sell at a higher price.

After the first meeting the following tasks were assigned:

1. How many houses are available to buy?
2. How many features they possess?
3. What are those features?
4. House with the higher price.
5. House with most rooms.
6. Max rooms in a house
7. How many rooms on the dataset.
8. Average price of 2 bathroom houses.
9. Minimum price of 3 bedroom houses.
10. How many houses with a living room bigger then 300sqft.
11. How many houses with living room bigger then 300sqft and 2 bathrooms.
12. How many houses with 2 floors.
13. How many houses with water view.
14. How many houses with 3 bedrooms and water view.
15.  Find the houses that we should invest and what budget will be spent per house.
16. Discover for what price the selected houses can be selled.
17. Analyze if houserocket should make refurbishments to raise the houses selling price.
18. Make suggestions of refurbishments.
19. Calculate what was the price increase compared to a not refurbished house

# 2. Business Assumptions

All houses possess lots of features that make them more attractive or less attractive to buyers and sellers. Location and season of the year can alter the price.
